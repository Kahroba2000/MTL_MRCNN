# MTL_MRCNN for Object Detection, Segmentation, and Attribute extraction
This model is a multitask object detection model, developed on top of MRCNN model.This model detect objects within the images, perform segmentation and extract meaningful attribute from the image.
The model is validated on head detection and pose estimation.

# Getting Started
For training your own model, first a jointly annotated dataset should be generated. The dataset contains the objects class annotation, segmentation and attributes. You can use www.ai-console.com for this.
